# Active Context: Channel-Aware Update System Implementation

## Current Task: Update Checker Enhancement

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

### Objective
Implement channel-aware version checking so that:
- Experimental versions (`-exp`) only receive experimental updates
- Stable versions (`-stable`) only receive stable updates
- Versions without suffixes only see non-suffixed releases

### Implementation Details

#### Modified Files
1. **`src/DataFunctions/updateChecker.ts`**
   - Added `getVersionChannel()` function to extract channel from version string
   - Added `filterReleasesByChannel()` function to filter GitHub releases by channel
   - Modified `checkForUpdates()` to use channel-aware filtering
   - Enhanced return object to include `currentChannel` information

#### Key Functions Added
```typescript
function getVersionChannel(version: string): string | null
function filterReleasesByChannel(releases: GitHubRelease[], targetChannel: string | null): GitHubRelease[]
```

#### Enhanced Return Object
The `checkForUpdates()` function now returns:
- `currentChannel`: The detected channel of the current version
- `message`: Informative message when no releases found for channel
- Improved error handling with channel context

### Technical Benefits
- **User Safety**: Prevents cross-channel promotions
- **Development Workflow**: Supports parallel release channels
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing version formats
- **Controlled Distribution**: Enables targeted rollouts

### Next Steps
- Test the implementation with different version formats
- Consider adding UI indicators for current channel
- Plan release strategy for both experimental and stable channels
